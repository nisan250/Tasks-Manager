# Tasks-Manager
Built with React &amp; Laravel

## Application Description
Manage tasks by creating, editing, and deleting tasks with the ability to filter and sort the tasks.

## Server
After installing the server in your host enviorment, add the client directory next to the server directory or change the path in server/resources/views/welcome.blade.php. this will make sure that the app will be functional without running the client.

## Client
Another way to work with the app is to do "npm install" in the client and then "npm run start". it will open in localhost port 3000.
